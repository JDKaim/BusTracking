# BusTracking
This simulation "tracks a bus" going from MIT to Harvard, plotting the stops that the bus takes along the way. The simulation can be run by pressing the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button.

Future Changes: Hoping to animate the bus going from Harvard to MIT, which would be triggered with a different button.
